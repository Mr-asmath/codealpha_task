The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between Flask and the version of Python you are using (`Python 3.11`). Flask and its dependencies may not fully support Python versions that are very recent or not yet widely adopted.

Here's how you can address this issue:

1. **Check Python Version**: Flask may not fully support Python 3.11 at the moment. It's recommended to use a stable and widely supported version of Python such as `Python 3.8`, `Python 3.9`, or `Python 3.10`. These versions are more likely to have better compatibility with Flask and its dependencies.

2. **Downgrade Python**: If possible, consider downgrading your Python installation to a supported version. You can download older versions of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Virtual Environment**: Create a virtual environment specifically for your Flask project. This helps to isolate dependencies and ensures compatibility with the chosen Python version without affecting other projects.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Reinstall Dependencies**: After activating your virtual environment, reinstall Flask and its dependencies to ensure they are compatible with the Python version you are using.

   ```bash
   pip install flask werkzeug==2.0.2  # Adjust versions as needed
   ```

5. **Run Flask Application**: Once dependencies are installed, try running your Flask application again:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `TypeError` related to `LocalProxy` and ensure that your Flask application runs smoothly. If issues persist, consider checking Flask's official documentation for any updates or known issues related to Python 3.11 compatibility.


***Train the Models: Ensure you retrain your models with the updated training script.***
sh
Copy code
   "python models/train_and_save_model.py"
***Run the Application: After retraining, run your application.***
sh
Copy code
   "python app.py"
